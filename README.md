# Smart Agriculture: Revolutionizing Agriculture with AI and IoT

## Overview
This project aims to revolutionize the agriculture sector by integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) to create a smart farming system. The system includes various modules that provide personalized recommendations for farmers and urban gardeners. The project utilizes machine learning algorithms like Random Forest Classifiers to predict crop yields and provide recommendations for better agricultural practices.

## Modules
The system is composed of the following five modules:

### 1. Smart Hydroponics Hub
Provides smart solutions for hydroponic farming, offering insights and recommendations for growing crops without soil.

### 2. AgriMarket Insights
Analyzes market trends and provides farmers with up-to-date market information to make informed decisions.

### 3. Large-Scale AgriTech
Focuses on large-scale farming operations, providing AI-based crop yield predictions and recommendations to improve farm productivity and efficiency.

### 4. Guide to Exotic Flora
Offers information on growing exotic plants, including recommendations for their care and maintenance.

### 5. Urban Green Spaces
Provides solutions for urban gardeners looking to optimize their limited space for growing plants and vegetables.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Languages**: Python, HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks and Libraries**: Flask, scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning Models**: Random Forest Classifier
- **IoT Integration**: Integration of sensors and devices for smart farming
- **Web Application**: Flask (for deployment)
- **Database**: SQLite (or specify another database if applicable)

## Features
- **Random Forest-based Crop Yield Prediction**: Predicts crop yields based on historical data and environmental factors.
- **Crop Recommendation System**: Recommends crops that are best suited for particular soil conditions, climate, and other factors.
- **Web and Mobile Application**: Provides an easy-to-use platform for farmers to access the system's features.
- **IoT Integration**: Gathers real-time data from sensors to provide actionable insights.
